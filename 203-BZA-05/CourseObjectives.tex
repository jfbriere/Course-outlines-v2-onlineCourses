\entry{Course \mbox{objectives}}
{The primary objective is to give the Science student a comprehensive introduction to astronomy and astrophysics, from ancient times to the present. The course will emphasize the logic behind astronomical thinking, rather than the memorization of facts. Classical astronomy will be covered, but more emphasis will be placed on modern astrophysics. Mathematics will be calculus-level.
