\entry{Attendance \& participation}{
Attendance and participation are keys to success in this course. In the rare event that a student for valid reason (e.g. due to an intensive course, illness, etc.) is or anticipates to be absent for a class, the student must, where possible, inform the teacher and provide the necessary documents before the absence or, at the latest, on the day of their return.
For additional information regarding attendance, students should refer to the Institutional Student Evaluation Policy (ISEP section IV-C).}
