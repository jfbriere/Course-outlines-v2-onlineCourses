\entry{Reference materials}{
\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\bf College Physics by Serway and Vuille, 10th edition}.  This textbook is available at the bookstore.  The e-book is available online; the price is lower (almost half) but, unlike the printed book, it usually has a limited lifetime (2 years) and it cannot be resold.
	\item {\bf Used book:}  Students may purchase a second-hand copy of College Physics by Serway and Vuille (8th or 9th editions), however they will be responsible for cross-referencing assigned readings and problems.  
	\item {\bf Library copies:} Copies of the textbook are available on reserve in the Dawson Library.
