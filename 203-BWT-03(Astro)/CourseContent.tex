While there is no laboratory component in this course, experimental verifcation of physical reality is a key aspect of science and as such some class activities will occasionally involve experimental measurements and the analysis of data collected in the class or acquired from film clips. No lab reports will be required for this course. There is also the possibility of a field trip to the Planetarium, and an evening observation session with a telescope.
