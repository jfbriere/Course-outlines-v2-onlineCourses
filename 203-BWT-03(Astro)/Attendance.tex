\entry{Attendance \& participation}{
In order to be successful, students are strongly encouraged to attend all classes.  Students should also arrive on time for the lectures.  In the event that a class is missed, the student is responsible for all material covered or assigned during that class. Students who do not have prior permission from the teacher must write the complete assignments and quizzes as scheduled, except in the case of unforeseen emergencies (proper documents may be required for verification).
\smallskip

At the end of every theme (approx.~2 weeks) there will be a quiz on the material in that theme. Students must write the quizzes at the scheduled times except for unforeseen emergencies confirmed by proper documents. For additional information students should refer to the Institutional Student Evaluation Policy (ISEP section III-C) regarding attendance.
