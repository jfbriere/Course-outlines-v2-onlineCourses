{In the rare event that a student for valid reason (\textit{e.g.}~due to an intensive course, illness, \textit{etc.}) is or anticipates to be absent during a quiz or in-class assignment, the student \textbf{must}, where possible, inform the teacher and provide the necessary documents before the absence or, at the latest, on the day of their return.  If the absence is excused, students will have the opportunity to complete the assessment.
\smallskip

All other assessments missed due to absence are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item assigned a grade of zero where the absence is not excused;
	\item given zero weight in the calculation of the final grade where the absence is excused.
\end{itemize}
}
