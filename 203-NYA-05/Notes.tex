\entry{Calculus}{A complete understanding of the material covered in this course comes with an understanding of calculus, and in particular derivatives and integrals. Calculus I is a co-requisite course that will introduce students to the basics of calculus and derivatives. In physics NYA concepts involving derivatives will be covered qualitatively initially and become more and more quantitative as the semester progresses. Physics using integral calculus will only be covered qualitatively in this course. Students are strongly encouraged to link the learning done in Physics and Calculus.}
