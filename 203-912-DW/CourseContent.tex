In addition, you will have to complete labs designed to give you a hands-on opportunity to learn about key physical concepts.  

%The following experiments will be performed:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item Measurement of density and error analysis
%	\item Force table
%	\item The boom
%	\item Static friction
%\end{enumerate}
