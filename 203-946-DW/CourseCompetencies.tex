\entry{Course \mbox{competencies}}
{This course will allow the student to partially achieve the following two competencies by covering all the fundamental physical notions required to attain a proper understanding of principles relating to human biomechanics and electrotherapy.

OO2Z:  To analyze the position and movements of the human body.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Analyze the mechanical forces and constraints placed on anatomical structures in a static position and during movements.
\item Analyze how joint and muscle structures help maintain positions and perform movements.
\item Analyze position of joint and muscle structures in static and dynamic situations.
\end{enumerate}
\smallskip

OO3H:	Provide electrotherapy treatments.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a favorable environment for the intervention.
\item Explain how electrotherapy apparatuses are used.
\item Use low-, medium-, and high-frequency current for antalgic, trophic and tissue repair purposes.
\item Use ultrasound for antalgic, trophic and tissue repair purposes.
\item Use radiation for antalgic, trophic and tissue repair purposes.
\item Use electrical stimulation and biofeedback for motor rehabilitation purposes.
\item Use direct current for iontophoretic purposes.
\end{enumerate}
}
