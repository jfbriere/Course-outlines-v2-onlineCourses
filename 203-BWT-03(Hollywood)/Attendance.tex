\entry{Attendance \& participation}{
In order to be successful, students are strongly encouraged to attend all classes and students are expected to participate actively in classroom discussions. Students should arrive on time for the lectures so as not to miss any part of the movie clips shown - these are central to the understanding of the course material. In the event that a class is missed, the student is responsible for all material covered or assigned during that class. Students who do not have prior permission from the teacher must write the complete assignments and quizzes as scheduled, except in the case of unforeseen emergencies (proper documents may be required for verification).
\smallskip

On a regular basis, students will be asked to complete small assignments in class which will be marked for the in-class assignment marks. These small assignments can only be completed in class so attendance is important. 
%The topic and nature of the assignment will be announced ahead of time but the assignment itself must be completed in class.  
\smallskip

At the end of every theme (approx.~2 weeks) there will be a quiz on the material in that theme. Students must write the quizzes at the scheduled times except for unforeseen emergencies confirmed by proper documents. For additional information students should refer to the Institutional Student Evaluation Policy (ISEP section III-C) regarding attendance.
