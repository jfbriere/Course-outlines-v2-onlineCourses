The course will explore the scientific method and particular topics in physics by exploring themes. Each theme will last about two to three weeks. Excerpts from movies and TV shows will be used to explore the ideas and misconceptions within a particular theme. Demonstrations and experiments will be 
performed to verify or refute what was seen in the clips. The bulk of the course material presented in class will be in the form of PowerPoint presentations and students will be asked to take an active role in the classroom.
