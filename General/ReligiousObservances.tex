\entry{Policy on \mbox{religious} \mbox{observance}}{Students observing religious holidays must inform their teachers, in writing, as prescribed in the ISEP Policy on Religious Observances, no later than the end of the second week of the impacted semester or term. This applies both to the semester or term, as well as to any final examination period. (ISEP Section IV-D) Please refer to the academic calendar for the exact dates. Forms for this purpose are available from your teacher. Your teacher will inform you of any modifications to planned course activities resulting from the teacher's own religious commitments.  }
