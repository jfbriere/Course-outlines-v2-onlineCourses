\entry{Academic \mbox{integrity}}{Cheating,  copying,  or  any  other  form  of  academic  dishonesty  will  not  be  tolerated. Students should acquaint themselves with the policy of the College on plagiarism and cheating.  According to ISEP, the teacher is required to report to the Sector Dean all cases of cheating and plagiarism affecting a student's grade (ISEP section V-C). The usual penalty for the first instance of cheating will be a grade of zero for the piece of work in question to all parties involved (under certain circumstances, even a first offence may be penalized by failure in the course).  A second offence may result in the failure of the course.  Students should note that using someone else's laboratory data without authorization from the student and the teacher is cheating.}
