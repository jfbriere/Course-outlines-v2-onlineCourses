\entry{Course \mbox{objectives}}
{This is a general physics course, covering topics in mechanics, electricity and modern physics, intended to provide a foundation for further studies in Radiation Oncology.
Since students may enter the radio-oncology program from high school with only a fourth-year course in Physical Science as science background, or be adult students, who last studied physics some years before enrolling in the program, the course presents the basic physics concepts and skills necessary for the successful completion of many of the program objectives, especially those concerning the generation of radiation and its interaction with matter.
