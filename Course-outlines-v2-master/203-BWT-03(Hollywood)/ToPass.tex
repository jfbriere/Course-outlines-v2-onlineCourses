\item {\bf If the student receives a grade less than 60\% in the term project, the maximum course grade they will be granted is 55\%.}

\item At the end of every theme (approx.~2 weeks) there will be a quiz on the material in that theme. Dates for the quizzes will be announced at least one week in advance.

\item On a regular basis, students will be asked to complete small in-class assignments and activities.

\item The due dates for the term project (including elements that may be required before the final project is due) will be specified by your teacher in the first full week of classes.
\end{itemize}

The student should be able to demonstrate a general understanding of the physical principles examined in each topic/theme, and to use this understanding to analyze the science portrayed in selected movies and television shows. Students will also produce one essay that is consistent with the level of a college student.  In order to pass the course an average grade of 60\% is required, calculated according to the evaluation scheme above. {\bf Note: course work not submitted by the due date may be penalized at the teacher's discretion.}}
