The lab work is an integral part of the course. Labs will be performed and will be taken from the following topics: electric field, Ohm's law, series and parallel resistors, Kirchhoffâ€™s laws, RC circuits, resistivity, identification of components and schematic diagrams. Students might also be asked to work on group projects to be completed by the end of the semester.
