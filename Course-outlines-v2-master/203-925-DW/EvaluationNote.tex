{Additionally, students must perform all lab activities to pass the course.

\smallskip
In the event that a student is or anticipates to be absent during a laboratory experiment or a class test (\textit{i.e.} due to an intensive course, illness, \textit{etc.}), the student \textbf{must}, where possible, inform the teacher and provide the necessary documents before the absence or, at the latest, on the day of their return.  If the absence is excused, students will have the opportunity to complete the assessment.
\smallskip

All other assessments (readings, quizzes, lab activities, \textit{etc.}) missed due to absence are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item assigned a grade of zero where the absence is not excused;
	\item given zero weight in the calculation of the final grade where the absence is excused.
\end{itemize}
