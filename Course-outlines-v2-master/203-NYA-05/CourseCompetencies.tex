{This course will allow the student to fully achieve the competency:

OOUR: Analyze various situations and phenomena in physics using the basic principles of classical mechanics.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe the translational and rotational motion of bodies.
\item Apply the concepts and laws of dynamics to the analysis of the motion of bodies.
\item Measure the amount of work and energy involved in simple situations.
\item Apply the principles of conservation in mechanics.
\item Verify experimentally a number of laws and principles in mechanics.
\end{enumerate}

%\smallskip
%This course also contributes to the partial achievement the competency:
%
%OOUU:	To apply what the students have learned to one or more subjects in the sciences.
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item To identify the scientific aspects of a given topic from an interdisciplinary perspective
%\item To transfer what they have learned to situations requiring the contribution of more than one discipline
%\item To apply systematically an experimental method
%\item To solve problems
%\item To use data processing technologies
%\item To reason with rigor
%\item To communicate clearly and precisely
%\item To show evidence of independent learning in the choice of documentation or laboratory instruments
%\item To work as members of a team
%\item To make connections between science, technology and the evolution of society
%\item To identify the underlying values underlying their treatment of a topic
%\item To place scientific concepts used in a historical context
%\item To show attitudes appropriate for scientific work
%\item To apply acquired knowledge and skills to new situations
%\end{enumerate}
