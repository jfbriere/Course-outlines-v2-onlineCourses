\entry{Teaching methods}{
The emphasis will be on competency development rather than on content, thus the teaching methods will be tailored to this end. Most of the class time will be devoted to student presentations, class discussions or to team work. Through the course, students will research various topics assigned to them by the teacher and will present to the group. Thus, they will get experience at exploring a new topic by themselves and trying to make sense of it. It will be clear that they are not expected to have gained a deep understanding before presenting, but to have collected a lot of pertinent information and matter for discussion on the topic. Through this peer instruction, the group will get an overview of the field. The students will also work on the various stages of an authentic experiment: design, writing of proposal for ethic board approval, planning, data collection, data preprocessing, data analysis, discussion of results. The role of the teacher will be to lead the students through a process very new to them and to add content when necessary. The approach will be adapted from the summer internship, which has proven to be very successful.
