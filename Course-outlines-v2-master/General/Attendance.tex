\entry{Attendance \& participation}{Although class attendance is not compulsory, students should make every effort to attend all classes.  In the event that a class is missed, the student is responsible for all material covered or assigned during that class.  {\bf Attendance during laboratory experiments and for class tests is however compulsory.}  In the rare event that a student for valid reason (\textit{e.g.}~due to an intensive course, illness, \textit{etc.}) is or anticipates to be absent during a laboratory experiment or for a class test, the student \textbf{must}, where possible, inform the teacher and provide the necessary documents before the absence or, at the latest, on the day of their return.  If the absence is excused, students will have the opportunity to complete the assessment.
\smallskip

All other assessments (readings, quizzes, lab activities, \textit{etc.}) missed due to absence are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item assigned a grade of zero where the absence is not excused;
	\item given zero weight in the calculation of the final grade where the absence is excused.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip

For additional information regarding attendance, students should refer to the Institutional Student Evaluation Policy (ISEP section IV-C).}
